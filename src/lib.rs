//! learnBevy is split into many plugins with their own set of responsibilities.
//! This is an organizational measure and not meant to be imply that you can turn them on or off at will,
//! since the plugins are interdependent.  
//! Instead, decide for yourself which features you like and which one's you don't and simply trim the code accordingly.
//! Feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/janhohenheim/learnBevy/issues/new) if you need help!
//! The docs are organized such that you can click through the plugins to explore the systems at play.
